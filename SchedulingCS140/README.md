The different iterations of the file is in the csv file which is also used for the training of the model

I used boundary testing, used some extreme values for getting different numbers.
To filter the results, I got answers that are good (no clashes) some in the middle of good and bad(0-10 clashes) and bad results (10+ clashes) balanced representation of scenarios with varying clashes
